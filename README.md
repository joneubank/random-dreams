# Random Dreams

Based entirely on https://old.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/ffvb4g/omens_from_dreams_an_all_dice_table/

Slight modifications made to clean up some of the grammar. See text in the file [dreams.js](src/dreams.js)

Plain site. Nothing fancy here. Should really make a template of this to provide output from other dice roll charts.
